    <!--
        1.  Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither.
            You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections.
            Here is an example, and here are some other ideas:
            Create a résumé page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
            Describe a trip you took.  Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.
    -->
    <!--
        2. And does each of the following:
            a.  Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>.
                If you need to review any of these tags, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.
                    https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp
            b.  Uses at least one <img> tag (hopefully more).
                When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
            c.  Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to
                use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
                    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp
            d.  Demonstrates creativity. Don’t stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great.
                And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!

        <p>Tell me something random...</p>

    <p>
        I cannot talk about myself or tell a story to save my life.  Luckily, the internet comes to the rescue.
        Here are several random paragraphs:

    <p>
        "Where do they get a random paragraph?" he wondered as he clicked the generate button. 
        Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? 
        At that moment he read the random paragraph and 
        realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same.

        The alarm went off and Jake rose awake. Rising early had become a daily ritual, one that he could not fully explain. 
        From the outside, it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely 
        no plans to be productive during the entire day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The day had begun on a bright note. The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, 
        and the birds were singing in its warmth. There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. 
        It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.
    </p>
       
    <p>
        The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. 
        The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. 
        How long had it been since someone had done that? 
        Ten years or more he imagined. 
        Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now.

    <p>
         The box sat on the desk next to the computer. 
         It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. 
         She didn't who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been. 
         As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life.
    </p>

    <p>
        She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. 
        It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. 
        He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. 
        It was the next step that was the most important.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It wasn't quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the situation. 
        At least that is what she was telling himself. The reality was that it was time to panic 
        nd there wasn't time to salvage the situation, but he continued to delude himself into believing there was.
